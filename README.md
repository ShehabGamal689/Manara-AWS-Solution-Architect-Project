üìå Overview

This serverless architecture processes user-uploaded images by leveraging:

Amazon S3 for raw uploads (source) and processed outputs (destination)

AWS Lambda (Python 3.9 + Pillow) for resizing/watermarking

S3 object-created events to trigger processing automatically

Environment variables to decouple code from infrastructure (bucket names, prefixes)

Optional integrations for uploads (API Gateway), metadata (DynamoDB), and workflows (Step Functions)

Your deployment (concrete values):

Source bucket: manara-image-resize-uploader (prefix: images/)

Destination bucket: manara-image-resize-reciever

Lambda runtime: Python 3.9

Env vars: DEST_BUCKET=manara-image-resize-reciever, SRC_BUCKET=manara-image-resize-uploader (optional guard)

üîç Component Breakdown
Amazon S3 (Source & Destination)

Source bucket (manara-image-resize-uploader)

Receives user uploads under images/ (e.g., images/cat-s3.png).

Emits ObjectCreated:Put events to Lambda.

Destination bucket (manara-image-resize-reciever)

Stores resized outputs in logical folders (e.g., desktop/, tablet/, phone/).

Block Public Access enabled; access via IAM or presigned URLs.

AWS Lambda (Processor)

Purpose: Read original from source bucket, create resized variants, write to destination bucket.

Key settings:

Runtime Python 3.9, Memory ‚â• 512 MB, Timeout ‚â• 30 s.

Environment variables:

DEST_BUCKET (required)

SRC_BUCKET (optional safety check)

Execution role permissions (minimum):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:GetObject"], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::manara-image-resize-uploader/*" },
    { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::manara-image-resize-uploader",
      "Condition": { "StringLike": { "s3:prefix": ["images/*"] } } },
    { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["s3:PutObject"], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::manara-image-resize-reciever/*" },
    { "Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["logs:CreateLogGroup","logs:CreateLogStream","logs:PutLogEvents"], "Resource": "*" }
  ]
}

Lambda Layer (Pillow)

Purpose: Ship native image libs (Pillow) compatible with Lambda.

Compatibility: Built for python3.9 and the function‚Äôs architecture (x86_64 or arm64).

Structure check: ZIP root contains python/PIL/... and python/Pillow-<ver>.dist-info/....

S3 Event Notifications

Trigger: Source bucket ‚Üí Event notification ‚Üí Lambda

Event type: PUT (ObjectCreated)

Prefix: images/ (recommended to limit to uploads folder)

Note: No Lambda ‚Äúasynchronous destination‚Äù is required; the function writes to the destination bucket directly.

(Optional) API Gateway

Purpose: Provide a signed upload endpoint or direct upload proxy.

Pattern: Client requests a pre-signed URL ‚Üí uploads file to source bucket without exposing credentials.

(Optional) DynamoDB

Purpose: Persist image metadata (uploader, timestamps, sizes, processing status, checksum/idempotency).

Partition key: imageId or the S3 object key.

(Optional) Step Functions

Purpose: Orchestrate multi-step processing (e.g., resize ‚Üí watermark ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí notify), handle retries, DLQs.

üîÑ Data Flow

Client uploads images/<filename>.<ext> to manara-image-resize-uploader (optionally via pre-signed URL).

S3 emits event ObjectCreated:Put with bucket/key ‚Üí triggers Lambda.

Lambda reads the source object (s3:GetObject).

Lambda resizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, phone) and optionally watermarks/optimizes.

Lambda writes each variant to manara-image-resize-reciever with keys like:

desktop/<basename>.<ext>
tablet/<basename>.<ext>
phone/<basename>.<ext>


(Optional) Lambda records metadata in DynamoDB and/or publishes a notification.

üõ°Ô∏è High Availability & Fault Tolerance

Serverless scaling: Lambda scales horizontally with incoming S3 events.

Retries: S3 ‚Üí Lambda invokes at-least-once; transient errors retried automatically by Lambda.

Idempotency: Use deterministic destination keys (as above) and/or checksums to avoid duplicates.

Concurrency control: Configure reserved concurrency if you need to rate-limit downstream dependencies.

(Optional) DLQ: Add an SQS dead-letter queue to capture failed invocations for later replay.

Multi-AZ durability: S3 and Lambda are regional, highly available by design.

üîê Security Considerations

Least privilege IAM: Scope the Lambda role to exactly the two buckets and the images/ prefix on the source.

Block Public Access: Keep both S3 buckets private; use pre-signed URLs for controlled access.

Encryption:

At rest: Enable S3 default encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).

In transit: HTTPS for all client uploads/downloads.

If using SSE-KMS, grant the Lambda role kms:Decrypt (source) / kms:Encrypt (dest) on the KMS keys.

Network: Consider VPC endpoints (Gateway/Interface) for S3 to keep traffic inside AWS.

Monitoring: CloudWatch Logs for Lambda, S3 server access logs (or CloudTrail data events) for auditability.

Validation: Validate MIME type/extension in Lambda to accept only supported image formats and reject over-sized files.
